CauFinder Documentation
=======================

Introduction
------------

CauFinder is a powerful framework designed to identify and control causal regulators of cell-state and phenotype transitions. By leveraging causal disentanglement modeling and network control, CauFinder provides insights into key regulatory mechanisms involved in various biological processes such as cell differentiation, cancer transdifferentiation, and drug resistance transitions.

CauFinder excels in distinguishing causal factors from spurious ones, ensuring precise control of state transitions. This documentation will guide you through the setup, usage, and application of CauFinder in different biological contexts.
